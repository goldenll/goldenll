### About Me: 

I am a former psychologist who took a leap into the world of technology as a software developer. After dedicating over a decade to providing specialized trauma care to underserved populations, I decided to channel my skills and passions into a new career path. 

As a software developer, I discovered an exciting opportunity to make a difference by blending my passion for helping others with my natural knack for working with numbers and data. It's been an amazing journey so far! Currently, I specialize in object-oriented programming and I'm eager to join a team of like-minded individuals who also value evidence-based approaches for problem-solving, promoting diversity in the workplace, and collaborating on initiatives that contribute to a healthier world.

Whether you're interested in discussing the intersection of mental wellness and technology, swapping tales from our travel adventures, or being dazzled by my repertoire of quotes from The Office, I'd love to connect. Reach out and let's chat!


**Likes:** cheese, The Office (US), hiking, Dolly Parton, ranch dressing, travel (planning and going), Halloween, and being on time

**Dislikes:** crowds, mustard, cilantro, excessive puns, science fiction/fantasy (don't @ me), slow drivers in the left lane, and being cold
